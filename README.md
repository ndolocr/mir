# Internet Freedom in Africa Gap Maps
This is an internet freedom gap map. It shows studies relevant for internet policies in and about Africa. The studies are empirical (based on primary data), focus thematic areas relevant for internet freedoms, linked to the content of internet policies, and conducted between 2013 to date. Researchers, policy makers and practioners can use the studies in the formulation and implementation of proper internet policies; monitoring and evaluation of the policies; and in the development of strategies and actions that affect control, direction, access, and use of the internet. Appropriate internet policies would enable peopleâ€™s internet freedoms as a right, an end, as well as enhance use of the internet in ways that improve their economic, social and political livelihoods.
